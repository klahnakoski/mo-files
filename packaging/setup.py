This is great for JSON files. It also provides better operators over some common file manipulations.\n\n\n\n\n## Recent changes\n\n**Version 6.x**\n\nGet a little closer to Python's pathlib module standards\n\n* `stem` - to refer file name without extension\n* `os_path` - to get the os-specific absolute path for use in other Python modules\n* `rel_path` - the given path \n* `abs_path` - was `abspath`, added underscore for consistency \n\n\n\n",
